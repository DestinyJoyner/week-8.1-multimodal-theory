    "\n",
    "#### Key Components Checked\n",
    "1. `result.scheme`:\n",

    "#### Purpose\n",
    "The main function orchestrates the entire image comparison workflow, handling user input, image downloads, analysis, and cleanup in a robust error-handled environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components\n",
    "1. `API Initialization`:\n",
    "   - Sets up Gemini API configuration\n",
    "   - Creates model instance with predefined parameters\n",
    "   - Handles potential API setup failures\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Image URL Input Loops`:\n",
    "   - Two separate while loops for each image URL\n",
    "   - Provides 'quit' option for user exit\n",
    "   - Validates URLs and file types\n",
    "   - Downloads images with proper error handling\n",
    "   - Gives user feedback on successful downloads\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Image Analysis`:\n",
    "   - Calls analyze_image_similarities with downloaded images\n",
    "   - Uses Gemini's vision capabilities\n",
    "   - Prints detailed analysis results\n",
    "   - Handles potential analysis failures\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Cleanup Operations`:\n",
    "   - Removes temporary downloaded images\n",
    "   - Ensures no residual files remain\n",
    "   - Maintains system cleanliness\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error Handling Strategy\n",
    "- Uses nested try-except blocks for granular error control\n",
    "- Provides specific error messages for different failure points\n",
    "- Ensures graceful exit in case of failures\n",
    "- Prevents resource leaks through cleanup\n",
